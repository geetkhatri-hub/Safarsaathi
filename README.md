## 🚀 About

**SafarSaathi  is a real‑time tourism safety and trust platform built for **Smart India Hackathon 2026**. It targets the moment travelers interact with unknown drivers, guides, hotels, and local vendors **on the spot — without advance booking** — and gives them verification, fair‑price context, local risk awareness, and evidence tools, all in one place.

> **Verify who you meet. Know what you should pay. Understand the local risk. Stay somewhere safe. Create proof if something goes wrong.**

The prototype currently ships as a responsive, installable web app with a **Passenger Mode** and a **Driver/Guide Mode**, backed by Firebase and a real 106‑hotel Vadodara safety dataset.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Tourists routinely face uncertainty during spontaneous, unbooked interactions:

- ❌ Unknown driver / guide identity
- ❌ Unclear or inflated fares
- ❌ Tourist‑targeted scams and touts near stations, landmarks, and hotels
- ❌ No reliable way to judge whether a hotel or its surrounding area is safe
- ❌ Limited trust in anonymous online reviews
- ❌ Difficulty documenting disputes or incidents
- ❌ Limited support in an actual emergency

SafarSaathi brings **identity verification, pricing context, location‑aware risk data, encounter records, and incident evidence** together into a single, mobile‑first platform.

## 💡 Our Solution

| # | Module | What it does |
|---|--------|---------------|
| 1 | 🔐 **Digital Handshake** | GPS‑linked rotating QR verification that turns an anonymous ride/guide interaction into a verified, timestamped encounter. |
| 2 | 💰 **Route Fare Intelligence / Price Pulse** | Shows fair‑price benchmarks for a route using recent passenger‑paid data, so travelers can spot inflated quotes before accepting. |
| 3 | 📷 **Price Camera** | In‑browser OCR (Tesseract.js) that reads a quoted price off a photo and checks it against the live fair‑price bracket, with a negotiation coach. |
| 4 | 📍 **Scam Hotspot Radar** | An interactive map (Leaflet) plus a full places directory that flags tout zones, fake‑guide spots, overcharging hotspots, and ticket scams, with proactive geofence alerts. |
| 5 | 🏨 **My Stay — Hotel & Area Safety Check** | Lets a tourist search a real hotel from the verified **Vadodara Hotel Safety Dataset (106 properties)** and see the surrounding area's amenities, distances, and safety‑relevant context — never a fabricated "safe/unsafe" label. |
| 6 | 🧾 **Proof‑of‑Presence Ledger / Digital Footprint** | Links reviews to a verified physical encounter (passenger → driver/guide → location → timestamp → verification token) instead of anonymous ratings, and keeps a trip‑by‑trip digital footprint with route snapshots. |
| 7 | 🆘 **SOS & Tourist‑Police Evidence Packet** | One‑tap bundle of GPS, timestamp, scanned license/vehicle info, agreed price, and photo evidence — built for reporting to Tourist Police (1363 / 112) — plus a delayed‑trip safety check‑in flow. |
| 8 | 🚕 **Driver / Guide Mode** | Lets verified drivers/guides register, generate rotating QR codes, and get scanned by passengers to complete the handshake. |

## 🧠 How It Works

```text
        TOURIST ARRIVES
              ↓
        Select Route
              ↓
     Check Fare Intelligence
              ↓
       Scan Driver QR
              ↓
  Verify Identity + Proximity
              ↓
      DIGITAL HANDSHAKE
              ↓
         Ride / Service
              ↓
      Review + Ledger Entry
              ↓
       SOS IF REQUIRED
```

**Passenger flow:** Open app → GPS/location → Route selection → Fare benchmark → Driver verification → Verified encounter → Trip/service → Digital footprint entry → Review.

**Driver / Guide flow:** Register profile → Add vehicle/license details → Generate rotating QR → Passenger scans QR → Identity/proximity check → Verified encounter → Trust ledger.

**Traditional platforms:** `BOOK → TRAVEL → REVIEW`
**SafarSaathi:** `MEET → VERIFY → CHECK PRICE → STAY SAFE → TRAVEL → PROVE`

## ▶️ Getting Started

### Requirements
- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- A modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox) with camera + geolocation permissions for full functionality

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/safarsaarthi.git
cd safarsaarthi
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the local server

```bash
npm start
```

(Windows users can also double‑click **`START_VERIDA.bat`**.)

### 4. Open the app

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## ⚙️ Environment & Configuration

| Variable | Where used | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `server.js` / `api/analyze-hotel-photo.js` | Server‑side key for the AI hotel/area photo review. Never exposed to the browser. |
| `VERIDA_VISION_MODEL` | Same as above | Vision model used for photo review (defaults to `gpt-4.1-mini`). |

Set these as environment variables (or Vercel/Firebase project secrets) before deploying. If unset, the **Add Hotel / Area Photo** flow will honestly report that AI review isn't configured and will **not** mark a photo as approved evidence.

Firebase and Supabase connection details live in `js/firebase-config.js` and `js/supabaseClient.js`. The app degrades gracefully to a local, in‑browser reactive storage mode if Firebase credentials aren't supplied.

---

## 📜 Available Scripts

```bash
npm start              # Run the local dev server (server.js) on :3000
npm run dev            # Same as npm start
npm run deploy         # Deploy hosting + Firestore rules to Firebase
npm run deploy:hosting # Deploy only Firebase Hosting
npm run deploy:firestore # Deploy only Firestore security rules
```

---

## ☁️ Deployment

- **Firebase Hosting** — configured via `firebase.json` / `.firebaserc`. Serves the static app with a single‑page rewrite to `index.html` and 1‑day cache headers on static assets.
- **Vercel** — configured via `vercel.json` (static output, plus the `/api/analyze-hotel-photo` serverless function).
- **Current live demo:** hosted on Vercel at [verida-alpha.vercel.app](https://verida-alpha.vercel.app/) — a temporary deployment for demonstration and evaluation.

---

## 🗃️ Data Sources

- **Vadodara Hotel Safety Dataset (106 hotels)** — the primary, verified source for hotel search, results, details, and map placement in Passenger Mode → My Stay. Coordinate quality is preserved and surfaced honestly: only a small subset of records have exact GPS pins, the rest use approximate locality centroids, and this is labeled in the UI rather than hidden.
- **Multi‑city seed data** (`data/seedData.js`) — tourism locations, transit routes, fare benchmarks, recent passenger‑paid examples, verified guides, and scam hotspots for **Vadodara, Agra, Delhi NCR, and Jaipur**.

No hotel, rating, safety score, distance, or coordinate is fabricated — where verified data isn't available, the UI says so instead of inventing a value.

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- AI photo review runs **server‑side only**; API keys are never sent to or stored in the browser.
- Digital Handshake combines **QR token + GPS proximity + timestamp** to reduce spoofing/replay risk from a single leaked signal.
- Firestore access is governed by `firestore.rules` rather than open read/write.
- This is a **hackathon prototype**, not a production‑hardened system — see [Roadmap](#-roadmap) for what a production build would add.

---

## 🔮 Roadmap

- Secure backend synchronization & production‑grade authentication
- Live government / RTO driver‑guide verification integration
- Real‑time data pipelines beyond the current seed/dataset model
- Stronger privacy controls and minimal‑data‑collection defaults
- Scalable cloud infrastructure for multi‑city rollout
- AI‑assisted scam detection, fare‑anomaly detection, and incident classification
- Dashboards for tourism authorities, tourist police, and transport operators

---

## ⚠️ Challenges & Mitigations

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Data accuracy (fares/hotspots/hotels) | Use verified datasets only; label confidence/coordinate quality instead of guessing |
| Privacy (identity, location, incidents) | Minimize data collection; secure backend authorization |
| Informal driver adoption | Offer a zero‑app / plate‑based driver verification flow |
| Poor tourist connectivity | Design for offline‑tolerant operation |
| QR/identity fraud | Short‑lived, rotating QR tokens combined with GPS + timestamp |
| Government integration | Partner with tourism departments & transport authorities |

---

## 🌱 Impact

- **Social:** Safer tourism experiences, greater traveler confidence, better accountability.
- **Economic:** Reduces overcharging, supports legitimate local drivers/guides/hotels.
- **Tourism:** Improves visitor experience and destination reputation.
- **Safety:** Faster identity verification, proactive scam awareness, structured incident documentation.
